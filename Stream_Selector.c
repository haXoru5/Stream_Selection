//Selection process:
//If below 4.0 GPA, student fails
//Students are sorted by GPA, highest to lowest (for society and management, students are counted in stream AND s/m)
//Keeps going down the list until cap for stream is hit
//Once cap is hit, if there are other students with the same GPA and choice below them, then ALL students with the same GPA are cut
